## you have access to the R code and the sqls related to the ipc patstat
## manipulations from the directory patstat_manuf.

## these scripts creates several directories and at the end the final
## data which is used in the analysis is wiod_manuf_net_VA_patent.csv

## WIOD data obtained from the web and changed into a long file
source("./wiod_manuf_data_prep.R")

## the long file is used on year basis for the calculation of network
## scores for each node. at the end, patstat data is joined to the final data.
source("./wiod_manuf_network_scores.R")

## this is last portion which produces all figures, tables that are used
## in the article. It produces latex tables and also txt tables printed
## on the screen. Figures are in pdf and png. Figures in pdf are used in
## the article. All results are stored in output directory.
